- `OSM_GADM.R``: This R script retrieves highway data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for a specified country and administrative region, processes it, and exports the results as a CSV and optional PNG visualization. It begins by downloading administrative boundary data using the `geodata` package, validates the selected region, and converts it into an `sf` object. The script then queries OSM for highways within the regionâ€™s bounding box, extracts relevant road segments, and filters them to ensure they intersect with the actual administrative boundary. The final dataset includes road type, geometry in WKT format, and segment length, which is saved as a CSV. If enabled, a map of the road network is generated and saved as a PNG using `ggplot2`.
